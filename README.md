## General info
This project involves a script designed for performing Joint Symbolic Analysis on ABP data recorded during controlled 
breathing sessions. The goal is to calculate JSDsym and JSDdiam values and acquire word distribution density matrices 
for every breathing rate.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.11
* Pandas library version: 1.4.4
* Numpy library version: 1.22.4
* Seaborn library version:  0.13.2
* Scipy library version: 1.12.0
* Matplotlib library version: 3.7.1
